# Instruction generation

Tools for generating instruction data.

## Usage

Using some example sentences, generate data where the instruction is
to correct errors in text, the input is text with character-level
noise, and the output is the original (clean) text.

```
python3 generate_character_noise.py data/example-sentences.jsonl 
```
